### Problem Statement

---

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` *if you can subset the array such that the sum of the elements in both subset is equal to sum or* `false`* otherwise*.



## Example



n = 6

arr = [5,3,7,6,9,1]

target = 11

Solution: is Possible = true

selection - i1, i2, i5
