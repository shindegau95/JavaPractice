### Introduction

---

* Recursive
  * Parent function calls the child function till base is condition is reached
  * Step 1 : Identify the base condition
  * Step 2 : Identify recursion
* Memoization
  * Many results in recursion are repititive
  * If we can compromise on space, this reptitive task can avoided by storing results in a data structure
* Top Down Approach
  * Iterative
  * Memoization computed intially
